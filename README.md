# Capistrano::Sentry

Simple extension of capistrano for automatic notification of Sentry.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano-sentry'
```

Then, add this line to your application's Capfile:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/sentry'
```

And then execute from your command line:

```bash
bundle
```

## Usage

Add these lines to your application's `config/deploy.rb`:

```ruby
# Sentry deployment notification
set :sentry_host, 'https://my-sentry.mycorp.com' # https://sentry.io by default
set :sentry_api_token, '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'
set :sentry_organization, 'my-org' # fetch(:application) by default
set :sentry_project, 'my-proj'     # fetch(:application) by default
set :sentry_repo, 'my-org/my-proj' # computed from repo_url by default
```

If you want deployments to be published in every Rails environment, put this in `config/deploy.rb`, otherwise put it your environment-specific deploy file (i.e. `config/deploy/production.rb`):
```ruby
before 'deploy:starting', 'sentry:validate_config'
after 'deploy:published', 'sentry:notice_deployment'
```

### Explaination of Configuration Properties

* `sentry_host`: identifies to which host Sentry submissions are sent. [https://sentry.io by default]

* `sentry_api_token`: API Auth Tokens are found/created in you Sentry Account Settings (not in the organization or project): `Settings > Account > Api > Auth Tokens`.
 [https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/]

* `sentry_organization`: The "**Name**" ("*A unique ID used to identify this organization*") from Sentry's Organization Settings page.
[https://sentry.io/settings/{ORGANIZATION_SLUG}]

* `sentry_project`: The "**Name**" ("*A unique ID used to identify this project*") from Sentry's Project Settings page.
[https://sentry.io/settings/{ORGANIZATION_SLUG}/projects/{PROJECT_SLUG}]

* `sentry_repo`: The `repository` name to be used when reporting repository details to Sentry [computed from `fetch(:repo_url)` by default -- `https://github.com/codeur/capistrano-sentry` becomes `//github.com/codeur/capistrano-sentry` and `git@github.com:codeur/capistrano-sentry.git` becomes `codeur/capistrano-sentry`]
